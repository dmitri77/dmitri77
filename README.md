Hi, I'm Dmitri, and I love programming. 

My strongest skill is web javascript (built multiple task timers app, a website for disinsecting company).

Javascript libraries I worked with include Node.js (built 1C configuration parser and have some experience with React Native), 
Three.js (researching this library's potential to be used for 3D presentation on work website), 
Phantom.js (mining dental clinic contacts on web for wife to use for cold-calling for her work).

I'm quite ok with Python: writing various scripts for manipulating data from multiple excel files, 
have tinkered with machine learning in Google Colab.

Lesser skills include Java, including Java for Android: built a budgeting app for Android using basic cryptography 
(where I used own auto-scaling algorithm for regular TextViews) and a text-mode Java chess game (college project).

I also have some experience with PHP: some MODX (work website), OpenCart (tried to make an internet store) and Bitrix (work). 
Some C/C++, Pascal and assembly language experience too (college). 

I aspire to learn Go and machine learning (currently studying in a machine learning program).

If you want to see if I could help you with a project, please let me know!
